# Alympics Lite Benchmark Suite
#
# Standardised battery covering all 5 canonical games with fixed configs.
# Used by `atp benchmark --suite=alympics` for quick agent evaluation.
#
# Composite scoring categories:
#   strategic  (30%): PD, auction, blotto, congestion
#   cooperation(25%): PD, public goods
#   fairness   (25%): public goods, auction, congestion
#   robustness (20%): all 5 games
#
# Each game section defines standardised parameters and baseline strategies.
